            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Microsoft needed a landingpage that should sell their Office 365 suite to small business, startups and entrepreneurs. They wanted  to communicate all the benefits and features their solution has with out making i feel too pushy. We decided to focus the
                campaign around a story of one of their customers, a production studio called Playground.
            </p>


            <div>
                <h3>Wireframes and Iteration #1</h3>
                <p>
                    We had a good idea of what content need to be on the page, so we quickly decided to jump into making wireframes. This helped with a quick back and forth dialog between us and Microsoft about what order different pieces of content should appear.

                    Initial wireframe for the Make Your Business Play campaign
                </p>
                <p>After agreeing on the wireframes we moved to the first iteration of the design. </p>
                <p>I came up with a a design where the images played a big role. We had great assets for this campaign, so we wanted them to shine as much as possible. Therefore we had big images and a simple layout.

            <div>
              <img src="images/microsoft/iteration1.jpg" />
              <p class="caption">
                  Top part of iteration #1
              </p>
                <p>
                  The design worked, but we felt something was missing. It was lacking a feeling of playfulness. We called up Microsoft and convinced them to bend the guidelines, so we could achieve a more playful and fun site. That leads us to…

                <h3>Iteration #2</h3>
                <p>
                    I continued working on the design, trying to loosen up the edges and many boxes of the site. This led to using big brush strokes as part of the design. I also found a new font that had the feeling we wanted the design to convey.

                </p>
                <p>
                  We were very close to the final design, and the rest of the process was going back and forth with Microsoft until we got the final details just right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the whole project I continuously worked on the mobile view, to make sure everything could work on different screen sizes. This is final design we ended up with:

                <p>
                  I was the sole designer on this project. I worked with the developer Christian and the project manager Martin.
